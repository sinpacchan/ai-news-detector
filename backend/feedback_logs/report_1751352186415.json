The cost-effective FPV drones have proven highly effective in destroying expensive military equipment.\n\nThe manufacturer has already codified the new rounds according to NATO standards, Brave1 said. The goal is to supply every infantry soldier with a magazine of specialized ammunition for use in case of aerial threats.\n\n\"These rounds that significantly improve the chances of hitting a moving target are a new development by Brave1,\" Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said.\n\n\"Our common goal is to ensure that every infantryman has a magazine of such ammunition and can equip his rifle with it in case of an air threat.\"\n\nUkraine continues to scale up its drone warfare capabilities. The Defense Ministry said on March 10 that it plans to purchase 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025 at a cost exceeding Hr 110 billion ($2.6 billion), with most of the funds allocated through the Defense Procurement Agency.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has set a goal of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.\n\nTired of military aid delays, Ukraine has designed its own ballistic missile ‚Äî and it‚Äôs already in mass-production\nAuthor: Anna Fratsyvir\nMOST POPULAR\n1.\nRussia pulls its scientists out of Iranian nuclear plant, as Israeli strikes threaten decades of collaboration\n2.\n'Unwanted by their homeland' ‚Äî Ukraine confirms Russia returned bodies of its soldiers disguised as Ukrainian\n3.\nRussia just accidentally admitted to its staggering troop losses in Ukraine\n4.\nRussia 'afraid to admit' scale of losses, trying to hide by dumping soldiers' bodies on Ukraine, Zelensky says\n5.\nTired of military aid delays, Ukraine has designed its own ballistic missile ‚Äî and it‚Äôs already in mass-production",
