She called the process \"rushed\".\n\n\"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognise that we're not there yet,\" she told reporters just outside the Senate floor, moments after the vote.\n\nA look at the key items in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'\nWatch: Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' triggers Senate face-off\nThe woman who could bust Trump's 'big beautiful bill'\n\nIn a game of political ping-pong, the bill now returns to the House, which passed its version of the bill weeks ago. If the narrow Republican majority in that chamber gives final approval, perhaps as early as Wednesday, the legislation can be presented to the president for his signature.\n\nBut it may be a tough pill for some House Republicans to swallow.\n\nIt includes massive new funding -$70bn - for Trump's immigration priorities. It boosts defence spending and makes the tax cuts Republicans passed in Trump's first term permanent. To offset this loss, it cuts funding for Biden-era environmental programmes and Medicaid, the health insurance programme for low-income Americans.\n\nReuters\nSenator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks to the press after the Senate passes US President Donald Trump's sweeping spending and tax bill, on Capitol Hill on July 1\n\nThe financial ledger isn't nearly balanced, however, as the package adds more than $3tn to the federal debt and raises the US borrowing authority by $5tn.\n\nFiscal hard-liners have complained that the Senate watered down some of their original budget cuts.\n\nThe right-wing House Freedom Caucus said the Senate proposal could add $650bn (¬£472bn) to the deficit each year. \"It's not what we agreed to,\" caucus members said in a social media post on Monday.\n\nAnd centrists still are concerned about cuts in the bill, including reductions in federal payments covering health insurance for low-income Americans.\n\nThe original House version was a balancing act that kept the various factions within the Republican Party just satisfied enough to vote yes. The Senate version now landing back in their laps may disrupt that balance.\n\nBut the pressure on House Republicans to sign off on what Trump has called his \"big, beautiful bill\" will be enormous.\n\nThe president has said he views the legislation as an integral part of his political legacy ‚Äì a lasting change in government policy that, unlike executive orders, a future president cannot easily undo.\n\n'Our food doesn't even last the month' - Americans brace for Trump's welfare cuts\nElon Musk says he regrets some posts about Donald Trump\nDonald Trump\nUS politics\nUS Congress\nUnited States",
