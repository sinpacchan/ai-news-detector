This is the code for Google Chrome browser extension that automatically detects if a news article is written by an AI, and if it contains misinformation.

This is a small sideproject I created to support my final thesis regarding AI and fake news detection for my Master's program at Kitami Institute of Technology, Japan.

To detect the articles, I have trained a BERT base model using fake and true articles written by both humans and AI-tools.

If you're going to use the extension, please take into consideration that the results are only predictions based on the pretrained model, so it is prone to make mistakes, especially since this extension is currently in very early development.

Consider buying me a coffee at: https://buymeacoffee.com/laslan07 to support my work in creating this tool more robust.
